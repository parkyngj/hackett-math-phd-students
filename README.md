# Math PhD Students Database for Hackett University

This is a Ruby program that uses persistent data to organize data pertaining to Math PhD candidates and recipients of Hackett University. It is intended to be used as a data entry and retrieval system to keep track of the students' names, advisors, specialty, grades, etc.

(Yes, that is a school name generated by the Faker Ruby gem.)

## Database Schema

![Database Schema](schema.png)

## Pre-Populated Tables and Entries

We have added entries prior to user entry to the database, as these fields, classes, and advisors existed prior to the creation of the database.

| ID  | Last Name   | First Name  | Field   |
|---- |-----------  |------------ |-------  |
| 1   | Blanda      | Adrienne    | 1       |
| 2   | Kassulke    | Grant       | 2       |
| 3   | Mertz       | Damaris     | 3       |
| 4   | Ratke       | Jerad       | 4       |
| 5   | Robel       | Stephan     | 5       |

#### Caveats

   * If you do not enter a date of matriculation when entering data for a new student, it will automatically put the current day's date.
   * If you do not enter a timestamp date when entering data for a new grade, it will automatically put the current day's date.
   * A student's GPA should not be updated manually, since will be calculated automatically by the data contained in the grades table.
   * A student's date of graduation should not be updated manually. Graduate students at Hackett University are marked as "graduated" automatically once they have taken 8 graduate classes.
