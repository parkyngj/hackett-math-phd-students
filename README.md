## Features

View, update, and add information to students, advisors, classes, grades, fields (of math).

#### Caveats

   * If you do not enter a date of matriculation when entering data for a new student, it will automatically put the current day's date.
   * A student's GPA should not be updated manually, since will be calculated automatically by the data contained in the grades table.
   * A student's date of graduation should not be updated manually. Graduate students at Hackett University are marked as "graduated" automatically once they have taken 8 graduate classes.
